# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Summary
We were tasked within this assignment to work with the HR deparment in order to help figure out when the next wave of retirements would be.  At PH there is a large portion of the work population born during the Baby Boom era so within the next several years there will be a high number of employees retiring.  Using programs such as SQL and pgAdmin we were to examine the data provided by HR in order to pull out all the employees set for retirement.
